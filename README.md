# rbx-wallstick
A system for sticking characters to surfaces within Roblox.

In its current form this system is client-sided only meaning that the it does not work in a multiplayer environment. This is because it would need a custom system for replicating player movement to the clients. Although this is most certainly possible I did not wish to write such a system in this repository.
